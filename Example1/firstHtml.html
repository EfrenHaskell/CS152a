            <p class="sidepanel">The examples on the left display the basic usage of multiple html elements such as paragraphs, headers, images and links
                Here is an example of an aside in a flexbox. This allows for text to be placed on the side of your webpage.
                This flexbox is also in a paragraph element which uses css styling to produce a background box and shadow.
                All styles can be accessed through the styles.css page. Below is a picture because I wanted something to take up space.
                <img src="thefaces.png" alt="faces picture" height="400px" class="center" width="250px">
